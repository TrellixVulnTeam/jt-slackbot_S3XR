  - Me? Jelly?
  - Yeah, you're jelly.
  - What would I be jealous of?
  - Maybe this fat ass.
  - Really?
  - For real.
  - Damn.
- - Are you amused
  - I'm ticked, but that's it.
  - So you're amused?
  - Yes?
  - Maybe?
  - Nope.
  - Okay.
  - For real.
  - Bop it.
  - Twist it.
  - Flick it.
  - Spin it.
  - Pull it.
  - Bop it.
- - Are you glad
  - You could say I'm glad, yes.
  - So you're glad that the earth is warming at an alarming rate?
  - You believe that nonsense about global warming?
  - Global warming is in fact a thing.
  - I didn't know you cared so much about the Earth.
  - Oh, I don't. I just live here.
  - You might die there too.
  - You never know!
  - I mean, you do sometimes.
- - Are you glad
  - Why would I be happy right now?
  - Am I happy?
- - Are you sad
  - Nope, I'm living the dream.
- - Are you sad
  - Not really.
- - Are you sad
  - Should I be? Did something happen?
  - I didn't want to be the one to tell you.
  - Please tell me!
  - It's your sister.
  - What about my sister?
  - She has the same grandmother as me.
  - We're cousins?
  - Yes, we're cousins!
  - That's the best news I've heard all day!
  - That we're cousins?
  - Yes, it's so cool! We have the same grandma! Holy shit!
- - Are you sad
  - Why would I be sad? Are you sad?
  - You didn't just see what happened?
  - No, I missed it.
  - I think you saw everything and just won't admit it.
  - No, I didn't see anything except the part where you shot Jessabelle!
  - I can't let you live.
  - Well, I'll be sure to haunt your ass.
  - At least then I won't be so alone.
